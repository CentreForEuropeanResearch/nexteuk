       <div class="container-1">
        <p> Born under the impulsion of the Centre for European Research (CER), the project investigated the future of EU-UK relations by assessing the latter’s historical achievements considering Brexit
             as well as the impact of major events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, to identify the best decision-making practices in policymaking.
             <br> <br> 
             In addition to fostering a dialogue between the academic world and policymakers, NEXTEUK’s other main objective was to ensure CER’s 
             ongoing mission of providing cutting-edge teaching and research in EU studies by involving a wide range of academic and political experts, 
             including the public.

          <p> After the Centre was awarded the prestigious Erasmus + Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence prize in 2019, 
              NEXTEUK had the opportunity to organize various events and conferences throughout the 2019-2022 period. 
              Although its focus was mainly on EU-UK relations, the project also explored how ongoing events happening at the global scale 
              were impacting the latter and the intersections of other issues that affect European studies and policies. 
               <br> <br> 
               Most of these events happened under the “think tank” format, where policy officials, NGOs, practitioners, business leaders, 
               and academics blended their expertise with academic activities through interdisciplinary forums.

        <p> NEXTEUK’s first international conference focused on the multi-faceted components and processes of Brexit from a European integration perspective. Despite being entirely online on the Hopin platform, the event successfully organized two policy roundtables and provided various networking opportunities and discussion for a between policymakers and academics. Key drivers of the two-days programme included:<br>
        -	The role of Euroscepticism and populism in EU-UK relations<br>
        -	How Brexit will affect EU external action<br>
        -	The roles of national and European parliaments in the Brexit process<br>

	<h3> Lectures </h3>
<p> Over the 3 years, NEXTEUK organised as many as 27 lectures and webinars/seminars, which happened through a partnership between London 
(Europe House in London and the European Parliament Office) and Paris (Maison Jean Monnet in Bazoches). With an initial focus on the European political space, 
they also covered timely topics such as the Presidential French elections and the war in Ukraine, to cite a few examples. Some of the lectures were organised in 
partnership with the Europe House in London and the European Parliament office, and Maison de l’Europe and the Maison Jean Monnet in Bazoches in Paris.

        <h3> Summer School </h3> 
        <p> NEXTEUK organised two Summer Schools offering an extensive range of lectures, resources, and advice provided by policymakers and leading international 
scholars to early researchers and PhD candidates in the field of EU studies. The Summer School provided a multidisciplinary program with the objective
 of honing participants’ academic and research skills. <br>
NEXTEUK 2021 Summer School’s central research question, “Researching post-Brexit and (post-) Covid EU-UK Relations: What impact on Policies, Methods and Theories?” 
addressed the methodological and theoretical tools to study the era of changes triggered by the UK withdrawal from the European Union. Due to the pandemic, 
the Summer School happened entirely virtually in partnership with critical online pedagogy scholars from the University of Colorado (ThinqStudio). <br> 
NEXTEUK Summer School 2022 focused on the research agenda(s) for post-Brexit and post-Covid EU studies. It addressed how these events impact the EU’s 
sovereignty and institutions, the state of trust within the Union, the concept of Europeanisation, and the politicization of European integration in those contexts. 
As the restrictions regarding the pandemic loosened up, participants in the second Summer School had the chance to assist in person in Paris, where, in addition to 
the two-day program at Queen Mary (rue de Constantine), they benefited from a two-day academic retreat at the Jean Monnet House in Bazoches.</p>

    NEXTEUK maintained a strong presence on social media, <br>

<p>Most importantly, the sign that NEXTEUK sparked <br>
    some interest as its activities unfolded throughout <br>
    the years is visible with the difference in top tweets <br>

    as the engagement rate witnessed a 62% increase <br>
    between 2020 and 2021.  <br> <br>
    This can also be seen through the sharp interest <br>
     in the project’s activities
     following NEXTEUK’s <br>
     first international conference which happened in <br>
     September 2020, 
    as there was a +103% difference <br> in impressions between the beginning of 2020 (22.3k)<br> and 2021(53.3k). <br> <br>
    Over the three years, NEXTEUK followers were mostly <br> interested in topics (top tweets) regarding <br> the Conservatives’ challenge
     of handling populism (2019), NEXTEUK international conferences (2020 and 2022), and the Eurozone crisis (2020). <br></p>

    <h2> NEXTEUK’S OPPORTUNITIES DURING COVID-19 </h2>
   <div class="container-10">
    <p> Despite the pandemic forcing the project to move 
        most  of its events online, 
        and the mobility restrictions rendering 
        the organisation of activities between London and Paris as 
         planned difficult,
        the pandemic provided NEXTEUK 
        with the possibility of extending its reach at a global level, 
         by saving the onerous cost
         of traveling for some of  the +300 participants to its events and provide some of 
         them with invaluable knowledge 
         that they could not have  
          acquired otherwise. Excepted Oceania, NEXTEUK had
           participants from all around the world. <br>
           Amongst its top 10 countries of participation, it accounted 3 non-European countries (Turkey, Brazil and South Korea).

    <h2>Academic Stakeholders</h2>
    <div class="container-1"> 
    <p>The two international conferences held by NEXTEUK had very positive feedback, with many participants (mostly with an academic background) stating that the topics assessed were fed directly into their own research; moreover, most participants stated that they would participate in other conferences organized by NEXTEUK.</p>

            <q>Yes, I think the Summer School has helped instil a greater sense of confidence when attending academic events/conferences. It has provided a reassurance that my research has relevance and is developing, even at an early stage. The skills I have gained or improved on include: - presenting - developing concepts and linking them to my research - exploring historical links to contemporary events - developing critical analysis skills</q>

    <p>The feedback for the PhD Summer School was very positive overall. Participants were highly satisfied, with a majority estimating that their expectations were met, either topic-wise (some stating that their knowledge about Europeanisation was deepened for instance) or academic-wise, as some participants underlined the fact that the Summer School inspired them for their future research. They also praised the Summer School’s opportunity of connecting and exchange with other participants. The “retreat” format at Jean Monnet House was one of the strengths of the Summer School, as its non-traditional academic atmosphere was a great factor of inspiration for the participants.</p>
